After clicking on the dropdown box, you then select the term that you want to look up classes for. If it is a "view only" term, that means it is not available to register under that term yet.

After the subject is selected, you then select the specific course that you want to look up classes for. These you can only do one at a time. When "View Sections" is selected, it will take you to that specific course information.

## Step 9: Read about the course from the catalog entry

Frame URL: [https://my102.iit.edu/banr/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=201710&one_subj=ITMD&sel_crse_strt=361&sel_crse_end=361&sel_subj=&sel_levl=&sel_schd=&sel_coll=&sel_divs=&sel_dept=&sel_attr=](https://my102.iit.edu/banr/bwckctlg.p_display_courses?term_in=201710&one_subj=ITMD&sel_crse_strt=361&sel_crse_end=361&sel_subj=&sel_levl=&sel_schd=&sel_coll=&sel_divs=&sel_dept=&sel_attr=)
